# 🪦 Memorial Pages MVP — Action Plan

**Business:** AI-powered memorial websites for funeral homes
**Owner:** Kameron Martin / KameronMartinLLC
**Started:** February 9, 2026
**Goal:** First paying funeral home within 3 weeks

---

## 📋 THE PLAN

### Week 1: Build (Feb 9-15)
**Koda handles this. Kam picks a name.**

- [ ] **Pick a business name & buy domain** ← KAM (see suggestions below)
- [ ] Template system (convert Rhodes page to reusable template)
- [ ] AI page generator (Cloudflare Worker + Claude API)
- [ ] Landing/sales page (what funeral directors see)
- [ ] Intake form (how funeral homes submit info)
- [ ] Deploy everything to domain
- [ ] Set up Stripe payment links ($50/page, $249 lifetime)
- [ ] Add funeral home branding section to template (logo, name, phone, tagline)

### Week 2: Demo (Feb 16-22)
**Kam's day off = sales day.**

- [ ] Print 10 one-page leave-behinds (QR code to landing page + Rhodes demo)
- [ ] Visit Tier 1 funeral homes IN PERSON (see list below)
- [ ] Pitch: "Free for your next 2-3 families, no strings attached"
- [ ] Get first funeral home to say yes to a free trial
- [ ] Build 2-3 free demo pages from real obituaries

### Week 3: Validate (Feb 23-Mar 1)
**Families react. Funeral directors decide.**

- [ ] Deliver demo pages to families via funeral home
- [ ] Collect family feedback (do they share it? add memories? love it?)
- [ ] Follow up with funeral director: "What did the family say?"
- [ ] If positive → close first paid deal ($50/page)
- [ ] If lukewarm → adjust and try next funeral home

## 🗣️ THE PITCH (What to Say When You Walk In)

### Opening (30 seconds):
> "Hi, I'm Kam Martin — I'm local, from Fort White. I just lost both of my grandparents three days apart last week. While going through that, I built something for our family that I think your families would really appreciate."

### Show the Demo (60 seconds):
> *Pull up Rhodes memorial page on your phone*
> "This is what I built for my grandparents. It's a memorial website — not a static obituary, but a living page the family can share and add memories to. I even found newspaper articles about my grandfather from the 1980s that nobody in the family knew about."

### The Ask (30 seconds):
> "I'd love to offer this free for your next 2 or 3 families — no charge, no commitment. You just send me the obituary info, and I'll build the page. You hand it to the family and see what they think. If they love it, we can talk about making it a regular offering. If not, no harm done."

### If They Ask About Cost:
> "For the funeral home, it's $50 per page. You can offer it to families at whatever price makes sense — most funeral homes charge $149 to $199. Every page includes your logo, name, and contact information, so it's permanent advertising for your business. The family shares it with 30-50 people — all of them see your brand."

### If They Ask About Ongoing Fees:
> "No subscription. No monthly fee. You only pay when you want a page built. That's it."

### Leave Behind:
> A one-page sheet with: QR code to the Rhodes demo, your name/number/email, 3 bullet points on what's included, the pricing.

- **Until then:** Build deploys to temporary Cloudflare Pages URL
- **After purchase:** Point domain → done in 5 minutes

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

**Week 1:** MVP deployed, domain live, demo page looks professional
**Week 2:** At least 3 funeral homes visited, at least 1 agrees to free trial
**Week 3:** At least 1 family receives a demo page, positive feedback received
**Month 1:** First $50 paid page sold
**Month 3:** 5 funeral homes actively using the service
**Month 6:** 10-15 funeral homes, ~$4k/month revenue

---

## ⚠️ KILL CRITERIA

If after 3 weeks of effort:
- Zero funeral homes will even try a free demo → Pivot approach
- Families don't care about the pages → Pivot product
- Nobody will pay $50/page → Adjust pricing
- You hate doing sales → Consider D2C instead of B2B

No shame in pivoting. The point is to learn fast and cheap.

*"The best business plans fit on one page. This is that page (plus some extra for the funeral home list)."*
